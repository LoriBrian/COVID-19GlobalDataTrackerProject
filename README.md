# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a Python-based data analysis tool that fetches, processes, and visualizes real-time global COVID-19 data. It was developed as part of the Python Development Module to demonstrate data handling, visualization, and basic reporting skills.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Load real-time COVID-19 data from an online source or CSV file.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset using pandas.
- Analyze key statistics such as total cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Visualize trends using charts (line, bar, histogram, scatter).
- Derive and report useful insights from the visual data.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – data manipulation and analysis  
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) – data visualization  
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) – statistical data visualization  
- [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/) – HTTP library (for API-based data, if used)  
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code for running `.ipynb` files

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid19-global-data-tracker.git
   cd covid19-global-data-tracker

2. Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the notebook:

Launch Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

Open covid_tracker.ipynb and run all cells from top to bottom

📊 Visualizations Included
Line Chart: COVID-19 cases over time

Bar Chart: Comparisons by country or region

Histogram: Distribution of daily new cases

Scatter Plot: Correlation between confirmed cases and deaths

Each chart is labeled clearly and provides insights derived from the dataset.

📌 Insights & Reflections
Identified patterns in the spread of COVID-19 over time and across regions.

Practiced data cleaning techniques and handling missing values.

Strengthened skills in data visualization and reporting.

Understood how visual analysis supports better decision-making in public health.

✅ Status
 Data loading and cleaning complete

 Exploratory data analysis performed

 Visualizations created and explained

 Notebook runs end-to-end without errors
